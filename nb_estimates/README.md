code to regenerate NB estimates based on variant calls. the matlab code in `./Popa_readInDataForNbAnalysis` reads in the parsed variant frequencies generated by `../data_analysis/scripts/process_nb_dat.py` and produces a matlab data file. `./Nb_analysis_code` includes the code to actually rerun the bottleneck estimation procedure originally presented in 10.1128/JVI.00171-17.
